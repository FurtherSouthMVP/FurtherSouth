The original idea for Further South, as a lower budget hotel based furry convention located at this end of the country, was bounced around as far back as late 2017, but although the initial proposals saw a lot of interest, some kind of pandemic got in the way of our realising our aims, until now. With restrictions dropping, venues reopening, and importantly prices returning almost to normal, we are ready to kick things off again.

The volunteer team that runs Further South comes from a wide variety of backgrounds and levels of experience, all drawn together by an eagerness to make this idea work. As well, we have liased extensively with the creators of many other, bigger and longer established conventions and brought on board their expertise. Our venue agent has worked with over 20 different furcons worldwide, while our ticket sales processors have provided their skills to around 50. As well as this, though, we always have space and opportunities for new people to join the team, if they are eager to get started in furry events staffing.

Our main goal here is to create a regular, normal furry convention, all the activities and amenities you would expect, if on a slightly small scale for now, but down in the south, and at a bit more friendly of a budget for our attendees. So far, our 2025 trial event has gone well, and things are picking up nicely for 2026.
