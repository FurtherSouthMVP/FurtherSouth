## Staff Recruitment

### [Application Form](https://forms.gle/3mU6HdkXtMzhnn6v7)

Furry conventions take a lot of planning, organising and running, and while we have a lovely team hard at work here already, there is plenty of space for more people to join them, as we look to at least double the strength of our team for 2026.

Many of the roles already covered will need additional backup and assistance, while spaces for volunteers to run around arranging tables, fetching equipment, answering attendee questions and more seem almost unlimited. By the time we arrive on the first day of the convention, we aim to have a dozen more names and faces added to our team, so why not put yourself down on the application and see if you can become one of them.

All staff members receive free admission to the convention, though unfortunately we are not able to cover accommodation or travel costs at this time.
