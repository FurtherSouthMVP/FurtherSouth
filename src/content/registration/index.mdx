## Ticket Options

To register at the convention, you will need to purchase a ticket of one of the following types:

**Day Passes** – allow you to choose one day of the event and visit all activities during that time. This year these are priced at £20 per person

**Attendance Tickets** – allow you to visit the venue hotel throughout each of the four days of the convention and enjoy all of the activities throughout. This year these are still priced at only £65 per person

**Residential Tickets** – includes your overnight stay at the hotel, with breakfast in addition to the Attendance ticket. Plentiful shared double or twin rooms are available for £255 per person, while a limited set of single rooms can be booked, running to £440 each. As well, check out our new offering, triple bedrooms, which let you share with both a double bed and sofa-bed for just £230 each.

## Opening Dates

Registration launched on September 1st, and will continue through to the end of January for Residential ticket options, and to the end of February for Attendance only and Day Passes. Ticket registration can be started at any time, the site saving entered data whenever you return, with no time limits on completing and paying your selection aside from the listed close of registration dates.
