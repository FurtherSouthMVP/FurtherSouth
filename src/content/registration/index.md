## Ticket Options

To register at the convention, you will need to purchase a ticket of one of the following types:

**Day Passes** – allow you to choose one day of the event and visit all activities during that time. This year these are priced at £25 per person

**Attendance Tickets** – allow you to visit the venue hotel throughout each of the four days of the convention and enjoy all of the activities throughout. This year these are still priced at only £65 per person

**Residential Tickets** – includes your overnight stay at the hotel at a discounted rate in addition to the Attendance ticket. New updated prices for three nights will be available soon.

## Opening Dates

Registration for 2026 will be launching later this year, around September. Watch this space or follow the social media accounts for up to the minute news as this new opening approaches.

## How to Register

The link below will take you to our Civet Solutions hosted registration portal. Here, you can enter your personal details, choose your options and make your payment all in one place. Payments are processed via the Stripe Payment Service, which runs off your credit/debit card numbers. All details are securely stored and processed on servers our team has no access to.

The form saves all of your details so you can start now and come back later. It also saves your entries from one year to the next, saving you time when you want to come back and join us again in 2026
