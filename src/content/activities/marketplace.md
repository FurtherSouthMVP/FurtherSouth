This is our creative hub, over 50 square metres of space for you to use making and selling your stuff. Come sign up to sell in our Dealers Den and share in the Art Show. Be aware that the Den may fill up quickly, and that we will be removing and replacing vendors that have not paid on time, to free up space for more people.

We will also be offering up space for enjoying drawing, writing or various other arts and crafts for anyone that wants to stop by throughout the convention.

## Art show

Welcome to the Further South Art Show! This is your chance to showcase your creations, whether they’re artworks, crafts, or unique items, for everyone to enjoy—and possibly purchase in our charity auction.
