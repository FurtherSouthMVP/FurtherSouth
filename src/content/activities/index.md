As a conference hotel based furry convention, Further South has the activities you might expect:

We will be hosting a fursuit changing area, ready for you to suit up and shuffle your giant carpet costumes slowly around the hotel corridors, or run around the neighbouring park chasing sticks, depending on your preference.

The main stage will be set up to host events to a large audience, including performances and evening musics. We will also be setting aside a number of slots on the four day long schedule to host your proposed panels, lectures, discussion groups, niche interest gatherings and more. Applications will open soon for submitting your events to host or performances to take to our stage, or send in ideas of things you would like to see, that other people might be able to run.

The marketplace will provide a space for you to host stalls offering your various merchandise and services for sale, as well as showing off artwork on our display boards, listing them up for auction, and also includes a small quiet social space, as well as room for drawing, creating and other fun activities. Check out the Marketplace tab for details on how to claim your space here.

Plans are always in development to add more as well, including looking at opportunities to overflow out of the hotel and check out tourist spots and outdoor spaces in the local area too.
