As a conference hotel based furry convention, Further South has the activities you might expect:

We will be hosting a fursuit changing area, ready for you to suit up and shuffle your giant carpet costumes slowly around the hotel corridors, or run around the neighbouring park chasing sticks, depending on your preference.

The main stage will be set up to host events to a large audience, including performances and evening musics. We will also be setting aside a number of slots on the four day long schedule to host your proposed panels, lectures, discussion groups, niche interest gatherings and more. Reach out to us at submission@furthersouth.uk with any suggestions of what you want to see or run for us.

The marketplace will provide a space for you to host stalls offering your various merchandise and services for sale, as well as showing off artwork on our display boards, listing them up for auction, and also includes a small quiet social space, as well as room for drawing, creating and other fun activities. Details on how to claim a space here or have your art on display will be made available in the coming months.

Plans are always in development to add more as well, including looking at opportunities to overflow out of the hotel and check out tourist spots and outdoor spaces in the local area too.
