Further South presents you with opportunities to host your own activities throughout the convention. Do you want to give a lecture on a favourite subject, perform on our stage, host a social gathering for a shared interest group, or offer up something new and exciting and original?

The events schedule throughout the four days has plenty of slots you can book for just this, watch this space for opportunities to offer your event or activity, or to suggest one youâ€™d like to see someone else undertake. Let us know what you want to run, whether you will need anything from us to make this happen, and we will see about finding you a space. The events coordinators department reserves the right to limit which activities will run, depending on available space.
