It wouldnâ€™t be a furry convention without the fursuits. Of course the venue hosts a dedicated fursuit lounge, with fans and other cooling equipment, spaces to dry fursuits, seats to rest in with plenty of free bottled water, and space to change in and out of suit and store your stuff.

We have a portion of the venue secluded off for furries only, or you can take your fursuit out into the rest of the building and beyond and entertain others. Do not interrupt or disrupt other events also going on elsewhere in the venue, and note that alcohol cannot be bought while wearing a suit head.

_Remember that your health and safety comes first. Feel free to strip out of parts of your costume when you need to while dehydrated, overheating or other similar concerns, without worrying about rushing back to the changing space first. Keep attentive for the signs of heatstroke. Remember that you can tell people to stop pulling your tail if you need to. Costumes do not automatically mean consent, get permission before hugging or other touching with fursuiters or while wearing yours._

We will also be arranging a dedicated fursuiting group photo, try to come along to this, though do be aware the fursuit lounge may be unusually busy shortly before and after.
