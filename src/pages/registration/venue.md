This is a large, conference centre based hotel in the suburban south of Portsmouth, Hampshire, a place that hosts a wide variety of events and activities throughout the year within a range of different size and style rooms. We will only be using a small fraction of their ample space this year, but are already looking at options to expand into more in the future.

The venue is located within the Southsea area, close to the beach, a few minutes walk from the pier and arcades, overlooking a massive park and just down the street from many bars and restaurants as well as local shops. This gives us many opportunities to expand out of the hotel building and look to official or informal activities in the surrounding city. Being in the heart of one of the countryâ€™s most densely populated regions also ensures many more people can get here quickly and easily.

As the convention continues to grow in popularity, we are in discussion to expand our room allocation for next year, and have arranged a flexible booking that will allow us to continue adding on more spaces as ticket sales go up throughout the year, adapting to our growing needs.

As well, we have access to use of a large lounge and relaxation area spreading through the spaces between these rooms, where guests can hang out, show off fursuits and meet friends.

We are also able to make a number of bedrooms within the site available to attendees at a low rate, these will be available to book through most of the registration opening time, though the venue does ask that we confirm numbers some weeks ahead of time, so make sure your registration there is completed, including any room share arrangements.
