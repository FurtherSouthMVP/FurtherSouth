## 2025

Forest Tails is back. An exciting, activity packed weekend away in the New Forest for you and a small number of furry friends. Book into our big lodge, or hire out a smaller 6-bed cabin for your group.

We will be running at the end of September this year, between Friday 26th and Sunday 28th. The venue has asked that we confirm all attendee numbers by the end of June, so be sure to grab your tickets quickly.

### [Tickets](https://reg.furthersouth.uk/kiosk/foresttails)

Activities available for you this time around include classics like archery, kayaking, forest orienteering, and in the evening a campfire.

Tickets in the main shared lodge run to only **£160** per person, including two nights accommodation and eight different scheduled, expert led activities, as well as space on the schedule for more informal events within the furry portion of the site. Smaller six-bed cabins are also available, slots here can be booked individually for **£180** each, or get in touch to hire out the whole space for your group for only **£900** between you.

The venue books events in sets of ten tickets, so we are currently limiting admission to only 20 people. If demand is high well before the closing deadline, we will increase this to 30 spaces, so sign up quickly or risk missing out.
