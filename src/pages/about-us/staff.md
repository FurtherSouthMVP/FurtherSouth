### Meet the Staff

DerpyDoo Designs, the source of pretty much all the more recent art used in our advertising and social media after many hours of work. Long time artist, occasional furmeet organiser, behind the scenes administration for the convention. Also chairperson for Further South.

Iresh Folf, experienced provider of music and technology to other furry conventions, now also providing the same expertise to us.

Millie, sound and lighting, lasers, pyrotechnics, all that fun stuff, usually on a much bigger scale than we have space for in the current venue.

Kit, long time furmeet organiser, helps out with starting a lot of new events up and down the country. Liaison with the venue and others as needed, agents, payment providers, equipment hire, tax office and more

Joy, lead organiser of the East Sussex Furs group, and frequent DJ, hosting a number of outdoor challenges and activities and providing both music and equipment for the evenings.

Pun King, game developer with long time experience at related events, regularly handling our social media, communications, note taking at meetings and other administration work

Hackney, not actually from London, just steals their names for characters, traditional pencil favouring artist, and eagerly working hard making things happen around the convention.

Rinzler, another game developer, more used to staffing game tournaments and conventions than furry events, eager to help out with sound and lighting and other equipment

### Staff on a Break

Ra, creator of a print furry magazine, registration staff and responsible for most of the organising of staff meetings, agendas, notes, to-do lists and other important work

Ghasteater, chipping in with bits of work all over the place, helping out each of the departments, we were also looking into getting some stuff written up in French to appeal to overseas guests, but thatâ€™ll have to wait until next year

Foxiekins, both a musician and an audio engineer, supplying all the sounds to furry events, with many years prior experience working at Furcation and now also joining us here too.

Bluegill, our long time customer service experienced staff member, here to make sure things go smoothly for everyone and issues are dealt with appropriately

### Other Special Thanks To

Trapa Civet and Alo Foxx of Convention Master, our outsourced registration and payment processing service, with over twenty years experience each, and more than fifty conventions around the world using their services, but always willing to help out with what our little event needs

Phil, with experience staffing various different conventions over the years and an in depth knowledge of technology and computing, helping out with advice, suggestions, encouragement, and knowledge of everything from how to set up radios to making our emails less likely to fall into your junk folder

Jennifer, our venue agent with two decades experience at a whole bunch of conventions, working from the office to source the best possible hotels and secure the best deals with them, saving you money and saving the hotel staff surprises as they learn what furries are.
