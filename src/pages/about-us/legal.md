## Terms of Sale

Admission to the activities hosted by Wyvern Events Ltd. is restricted to those that have registered and paid through our website, or arranged a transfer or alternative payment method through the reg team. Any attempt to get into event space without a ticket, or any attempt to trick our reg service into recording a sale without funds changing hands will be rejected. We can clearly see who has paid and who hasn’t.

At present, tickets for Further South are only available to purchase for individuals that are over the age of 18 on the start date of the convention. Admission to other activities is on a 16+ basis, due to the legal complications surrounding having staff become responsible for unaccompanied children. As well, all attendees purchasing tickets must provide ID proving their age and the name by which they registered.

Activities listed on this site are private events, hosted and run by Wyvern Events, and as such, we reserve the right to restrict activities, behaviour, items on display and individuals for any reason **_at any time_**.

If you need to for any reason change the name by which you are registered by, for example a legal change of name, you are able to do this by accessing [your account](https://reg.furthersouth.uk/kiosk/furthersouth).

The venue hosting us has their own rules, regulations and staff who are within their rights to remove guests from the premises for severe enough violations, at their own discretion. You MUST read the venue’s terms as well as you will be bound by them by attending; even more so if you are staying overnight in the hotel.

Being removed from the venue for inappropriate behaviour does not guarantee a refund on any unused portions of your registration.

As a non-profit entity, and funds raised by Wyvern Events above the cost of the convention must be either provided to another non-profit such as our chosen charity or another furry event company, or used to support our stated aim, providing more and better quality furry events in the area. This may include funding other smaller events or holding onto the funds to support the following year’s convention. By personal preference, any excess funds raised from donations or ticketed events are dispersed on a downwards trajectory, that is, they support activities of the same or lower entry price than the ones that raised the money. Should Wyvern Events cease to operate, any remaining funds and physical assets after refunds must be disposed of in this same manner.

## **Code of Conduct**

**Rule 0** – Do not behave in a way that interferes with others’ enjoyment of the convention. This covers any part of the hotel including other guests’ bedrooms and locations away from the venue when as part of an official convention run visit. This includes no deliberate unwanted contact, no showing adult rated material in public areas and more besides.

Minor infractions may result in warnings before any further action is taken. We would prefer to avoid removing paying guests from the premises, but be aware that it is an action we may have to take in sufficiently severe circumstances.

Behaviour that would normally be disallowed may be permitted if scheduled in advance to ensure that all those present are in agreement.

**Rule 1** – The venue also has rules and regulations, and these must be followed at all times on the site, as must those rules of other locations visited during the period of the convention. Rule content and contact details for enquiries can be found on the [hotel website](https://www.marriott.com/en-gb/hotels/pmeha-portsmouth-marriott-hotel/overview/).

Replica weapons that look too similar to the real thing as to cause confusion will not be allowed, other props must follow Rule 0 and not be a nuisance to other guests. [staff@furthersouth.uk](mailto:staff@furthersouth.uk) can be contacted to confirm any specific items. Items not allowed will be held for safe-keeping until the end of the event.

The showing of ‘adult rated’ material, including suggestive costumes or clothing, toys, equipment or art work is not allowed in public areas, that is anywhere outside your own or an approving other guest’s bedroom area. This can be subjective and as such in cases of uncertainty, staff can be contacted for questions, and warnings given on site for ‘borderline’ situations. This includes art work in the Art Show, and submissions to run event panels. The restriction on scheduled events may be lifted in limited circumstances. Showing 18+ artwork, either for sale or as examples in the Marketplace must be done discretely and only to viewers that wish to see it.

While our commitment is to make this a welcoming space for all, and to allow for a range of expressions of art and costuming and other aspects of the fandom, a line must sometimes be drawn, and the only way this can work for everyone is if that line is respected when it comes up.
