Music performances run throughout every evening of the convention, including both sets performed by local community DJs (get in touch at staff@furthersouth.uk or via our social media to offer yourself here) and the always popular karaoke night. We will have the stage and dancefloor set up for you in the main events room, with easily capacity for the entire conventionâ€™s attendance. Seating areas and a private extra bar right nearby are also provided throughout this period.

We can also accommodate live stage performances in the evenings. These will be available as part of the Events Proposals form when these spaces open in coming months. Rest assured that we will be confirming schedules of events, performances and DJs well in advance of any registration deadlines.
