# The Marketplace
This is our creative hub, over 50 square metres of space for you to use making and selling your stuff. Watch this space as we start to open for both Dealers Den and Art Show spaces in the coming months. Be aware that the Den may fill up quickly, and that we will be removing and replacing vendors that have not paid on time, to free up space for more people. Opening dates will be advertised well in advance, and confirmation of spaces will be completed well before any registration deadlines.

We will also be offering up space for enjoying drawing, writing or various other arts and crafts for anyone that wants to stop by throughout the convention.
